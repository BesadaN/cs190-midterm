## Directions

There are four parts, each with their own directions. Each is worth 5 points. So there are 20 points total.

I encourage you to quit and restart Xcode when working on different parts and only work on one part at a time.

### Directions for Parts I, II and III

These parts are playgrounds. The directions in the playgrounds themselves.

### Directions for Part IV

This is an app. Basically you have to fix some constraints and connect a button up to do something.

Part IV A) 1 pt.  The app has a big label that shows "0" initially. Add a constraint that makes the label's aspect ratio 1:1.

Part IV B) 1 pt. Add a constraint that makes the label's leading edge 20 pixels to the right of the increment button's trailing edge.

HINT: If you do the preceding two things correctly, the yellow tringles showing layout warnings will go away.

PART IV C) 2 pts. Look at the file ViewController.swift. Find the function incrementCounter(). Create a very similar function called decrementCounter().

PART IV D) 1 pt. Make the Decrement button fire the decrementCounter() method.

HINT: You do the last step with control-dragging in the storyboard from the decrement button to the view controller. If you do it right and you run the app, the counter will both increment and decrement.
