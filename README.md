## Directions

There are four parts, each with their own directions. Each is worth 5 points. So there are 20 points total.

I strongly encourage you to quit and restart Xcode when working on different parts and only work on one part at a time.

Xcode can get pretty unhappy working on multiple projects that are in the same repo simultaneously.

Parts I, II and III are playgrounds. You will find the directions in the playgrounds themselves.

Part IV is an app.

Here are the direcitons for Part IV:

The app has a giant label that says zero.

Part IV A) 1 pt. Add a constraint that makes the label's aspect ratio 1:1.

Part IV B) 1 pt. Add a constraint that makes the label's leading edge 20 pixels to the right of the Increment Button's trailing edge.

HINT: If you do the preceding two things correctly, the layout warnings will go away.

PART IV C) 2 pts. Look at ViewController.swift. Find the function incrementCounter(). Create a very similar function called decrementCounter().

PART IV D) 1 pt. Make the Decrement button fire the decrementCounter() method.

HINT: You do the last step with control-dragging in the storyboard from the decrement button to the view controller. If you do it right and you run the app, the counter will both increment and decrement.
