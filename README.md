## Test-Taking Rules

1. You can't consult each other on-line or look at each others' forks of this midterm.
2. However, you can use any other on-line references, especially all the repos we already created for this course, like cs190-ps4 as a good example.
3. Please allow about five minutes at the end say from 11:15 to 11:20, to be absolutely sure you have committed your work to your fork on GitHub.
4. If you bombed this exam, I've decided that the grade on the final exam can replace the grade on this exam, if it is higher. So you'll have a second chance to demonstrate that you know Swift.
5. If you want your midterm to stay private, I can show you right after class how to use GitHub to do that.

## Scoring

Each Part is worth 5 points. So there are 20 points total.

I recommend you quit and restart Xcode when working on different parts and only work on one part at a time. Don't get bogged down on a part. If a part is taking you more than 15 minutes, move along.

### Directions for Parts I, II and III

These three parts are playgrounds. You'll find the directions in the playgrounds themselves.

### Directions for Part IV

This is an app. Basically you have to fix two constraints, create a method, and connect a button to it.

Part IV A) 1 pt.  The app has a big label that shows "0" initially. Add a constraint that makes the label's aspect ratio 1:1.

Part IV B) 1 pt. Add a constraint that makes the label's leading edge 20 pixels to the right of the increment button's trailing edge.

HINT: If you do the preceding two things correctly, the yellow tringles showing layout warnings will go away.

PART IV C) 2 pts. Look at the file ViewController.swift. Find the function incrementCounter(). Create a very similar function called decrementCounter().

PART IV D) 1 pt. Make the Decrement button fire the decrementCounter() method.

HINT: You do the last step with control-dragging in the storyboard from the decrement button to the view controller. If you do it right and you run the app, the counter will both increment and decrement.
