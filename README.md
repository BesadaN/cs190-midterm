## Directions

There are four parts, each with their own directions. Each is worth 5 points. So there are 20 points total.

I strongly encourage you to quit and restart Xcode when working on different parts and only work on one part at a time.

Xcode can get pretty unhappy working on multiple projects that are in the same repo simultaneously.

The first three parts are playgrounds.

The last part is an app.
